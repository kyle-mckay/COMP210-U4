# COMP210 Project 4 - Virus Hoaxes and Scams

Hello, welcome to this page! The main page acts as a method of navigation, as well as another way to overview the project requirements. As you can see, I opted to do the multi-page website instead of power points. This submission is built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)!

In order to view this submission properly, ensure you are accessing it via the [submitted link](https://kyle-mckay.github.io/COMP210-U4/) to GitHub pages. If you would like to view one of the topics, you can select one of the links in the sidebar, or check out the requirements in the [About](/desc.md) page.
