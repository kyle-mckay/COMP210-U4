# Getting Help on Hoaxes

While Virus Hoaxes are generally not a threat, if you receive either a suspicious email or one that talks about a virus is contact your IT Help Desk if in a work enviroment. Alternatively, you should exercise the same amount of caution as you would any other potentially malicious email.

- Be careful interacting with any attachments
- Ensure your Anti-Virus databases are up to date.
- Do not follow any instructions that are being asked from an untrustworthy source.
