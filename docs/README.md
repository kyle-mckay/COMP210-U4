## What are Virus Hoaxes?

Virus Hoaxes are **Phony virus warnings** delivered via email <sup>[1]</sup> designed to either upset <sup>[1]</sup> people or convince pepole they need to take action such as deleting crucial operating system files <sup>[2]</sup>. In most instances, a virous hoax is of no real threat to the user or their system if either unactioned or ignored. That said, while they are annoyances, this oversaturation of false warnings may lead to users routinely ignoring all virus warnings they see, potentially including **genuine threats** <sup>[3]</sup>.
