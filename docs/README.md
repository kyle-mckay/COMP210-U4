# COMP210 Project 1 - A Terminology Website

Hello, welcome to this page! The main page acts as a method of navigation, as well as another way to overview the project requirements. Instead of coding in HTML or using a standard SaaS website provider, I opted to go with a less traditional approach and use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)!

In order to view this submission ensure you are accessing it via the [submission link](https://kyle-mckay.github.io/COMP210-U1/) to GitHub pages. If you would like to view one of the topics, you can select one of the links in the sidebar, or check out the requirements in the [About](/desc.md) page.
