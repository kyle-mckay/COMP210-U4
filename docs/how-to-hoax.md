<ul>
<li>The message is forwarded to you by a friend or colleague.</li>
<li>The message usually does not contain an attachment</li>
<li>The message urges you to forward the email to everyone you know.</li>
<li>The email describes in detail the alleged virus and what it is capable of doing to your system. It does not include a link to a known antivirus website such as Norton or McAfee. A legitimate virus warning will include a link to these trusted sites for more information regarding the virus.</li>
<li>The message sometimes encourages you to delete or rename system files in order to protect your system from infection. Doing so often prevents windows from functioning properly.</li>
<li>The message references a third party who can validate the claim.</li>
</ul></td>
