# What are Ransomware Scams?

According to the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, "Ransomeware is the most common cyber threat Canadians face"<sup>[1]</sup>. So what does it do? Put simply, in a ransomware attack your computer/systems have their files encrypted, stolen or deleted. Afterwards, the attackers demand a payment as ransom to restore the data <sup>[1]</sup>.

"Ransomware incidents can severely impact business processes and leave organizations without the data they need to operate and deliver mission-critical services. The economic and reputational impacts of ransomware incidents, throughout the initial disruption and, at times, extended recovery, have also proven challenging for organizations large and small. Apply these tips and practices to avoid attack." <sup>[2]</sup>
